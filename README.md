# Qualification seminar teaching materials 2018

This repository contains the course materials for the first session of the qualification seminar.

With your ITU account, which is also a Microsoft LiveID, you can run the notebooks on _Azure Notebooks_ by clicking on: [![AzureNB](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/itu-summer/session-1)


## Material life-cycle

Each session will be updated in three steps:

Before the session starts we will publish the material you need to follow the session. In the current directory the `Talk to me.ipynb` and `Notebook.ipynb` is all that you need.
After the session is over, we will publish all our slides, solutions to code exercises in the class as well as information on the homework.
Finally, after the homework has been handed in, the homework solutions will be published.
We strongly recommend that you validate/verify your results.

Now, you can see your repositories, such as the `session-1`. If you click on a repository you will be able see and access all the different files in that repository. You will even be able to open the `.ipynb` files, which is a Python notebook, without having to install Python on you computer first. So now, if you navigate in to the 'session-1' repository, you can chat with _ELIZA_ by opening the `Talk to me.ipynb`.


To write your first program open the `Notebook.ipynb` by clicking on it.
