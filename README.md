## Material life-cycle

Each session will be updated in three steps:

Before the session starts we will publish the material you need to follow the session. In the current directory the `Talk to me.ipynb` and `Notebook.ipynb` is all that you need.
After the session is over, we will publish all our slides, solutions to code exercises in the class as well as information on the homework.
Finally, after the homework has been handed in, the homework solutions will be published.
We strongly recommend that you validate/verify your results.
